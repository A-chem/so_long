A **framework** is a pre-built set of components or libraries that help you structure and build applications by providing ready-to-use tools, conventions, and often code to handle common tasks. Frameworks are designed to make development faster and more consistent by abstracting complex, repetitive, or low-level functionality into higher-level operations([[OpenGL]], [[Minilibx]]...)
