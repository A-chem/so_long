The **Display System** is essentially the part of the computer that takes care of displaying visual content on your screen. This involves:

1. Managing how things are displayed on the screen.
2. Handling how content is drawn to the display.
3. Coordinating input events (e.g., mouse clicks, key presses) to ensure everything runs smoothly.

On macOS, the **Display System** is managed by the [[WindowServer]].
