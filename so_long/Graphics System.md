The **graphics system** on a computer involves everything that allows your program to display visual content on the screen. This includes how the screen shows the images, shapes, and text you see when you open a program. It's like the "machine" behind the scenes that makes your graphics appear.

It consists of a few important parts:

1. [[Display System]] (like [[WindowServer]] on macOS)
2. [[Graphics APIs]] (like [[Quartz]] and [[Metal ]]on macOS)
3. [[GPU]]the hardware that actually "draws" on the screen.
