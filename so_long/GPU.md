The **GPU** (Graphics Processing Unit) is a specialized hardware component designed to accelerate the rendering of images and videos. It is responsible for:

- **Rendering graphics**: Drawing shapes, textures, and 3D objects on the screen.
- **Offloading calculations**: Performing parallel calculations for tasks like 3D rendering and shaders, freeing up the CPU.
- **Managing memory**: Storing textures, shaders, and frame buffers that are used during the rendering process.

The **GPU** works directly with graphical APIs like **OpenGL**, **DirectX**, and **Metal** to render graphics and perform calculations that would be too resource-intensive for the **CPU**
